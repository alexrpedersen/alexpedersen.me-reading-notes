### _CSS_
*Color
Conveys the mood of the page and makes it pop
You can specify color using rgb, hexidecimals or the names of the colors
color picker is super useful 
Make sure to have enough contrast 
Opacity is an option

*Text
There is a limited amount of fontts to choose from because you can already assume the ones that users have installed on whatever device they are using 
you can change the font, size, weight, style, and spacing of the text 
You can pretty much adjust the text to what ever space, height, space between, anyway you want to minipulate it.
You can change the pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have to visit a link

### _HTML_
*Images
The <img> tag is used to add images to the web page
You always use the src attribute to indicate the location of the image and always add an alt attribute to describe the content of the image so that if the page fails to load the image or someone who is impaired knows what that image is supposed to be.
You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format
Photos should always be saved as jpegs. Illustrations or logos that use flat colors should be saved as gifs.
