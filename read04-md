### _CSS_
*Layout Strategies
<div> tags are best used to group up elements inside your html 
Browsers always display in a normal flow unless specified by either relative, absolute, or fixed 
You can use more than one css file per page
fixed width or liquid layouts 
Float property 
Grids help making adding new content to the page easy and helps the user navigate the page better

### _JavaScript_
*Paired Programming
Paired programming is a way for people to connect and develope skills that will be used in the work enviroment. It helps with communication and also helps with social interaction that you might not experience out in the real world. It helps to have this interaction in the work place because not only does it help you communication and socialbilty but also helps with job readiness and the interviews to come. By doing these things employers will be happy to here that you are willing to communicate with others and work with a team. 

*Functions
A function only contains one statement 
The function can store instructions for a specific task that can be called upon at request and executes that code within the block. when the function is finished it continues to run the code from the point at which the function was called.
Function can return more than one value by using an array 
Local variables that are stored in the function can only be used in that function
global variabls can be used anywhere in the script 
The more variables that you declare the more memory it takes and then it can perform slower which will respond slower to the user.
Using two global variables in opposite script files can cause bugs in your code because two vars have been declared of the same name and it wont run properly
The values that are declared in the parentheticals are called arguments. These can be provided as values or variables.
function sayHello() {
  document.write('Hello!');
}



### _HTML_
*Links 
Links are created by using the <a> tag 
the href atribute is used to indicate the page you are linking to 
If linking within the page you should use relative links 
The id atribute is also a smart idea to link with the html
