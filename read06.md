### _JavaScript_

* Objects
  Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. 

*In an object variables become known as properties.
  Properties tell us about the object such as the name of the hotel and how many rooms it has. Each individual hotel might have a different name and a different number of rooms.

*In an object functions become known as methods.
  Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object. For example, you can check how many rooms are available by subtracting the number of booked rooms from the total number of rooms.

*Both Both properties and methods have a name and a value. In an object that name is called a key.
  You cannot have two keys of the same name in an object
  properties can have any type but methods have to be functions.
